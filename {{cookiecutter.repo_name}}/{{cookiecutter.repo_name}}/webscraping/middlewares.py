    """Downloader middleware for filtering bad final urls.

    The aim of this downloader middleware is to recognize and drop responses
    of which final urls are not within domains allowed by a spider.

    This allows for omitting offsite redirects etc. that in general
    are of no use since they have different HTML markup and can not
    be scraped correctly.

    This middleware additionaly uses optional `blacklist_urls` attribute
    to filter out unwanted urls (based on fixed string and/or regexps).
